## Step 1: Create Products

1. Go to Dashboard → Products
2. Create a subscription product
3. Set your pricing
4. Copy the **Variant ID**

## Step 2: Set Up Webhooks

Create a webhook in Settings → Webhooks with these events:

- `subscription_created`
- `subscription_updated`
- `subscription_payment_failed`

## Step 3: Add Environment Variables

```bash
LEMONSQUEEZY_API_KEY=lmsq_xxx
LEMONSQUEEZY_STORE_ID=12345
