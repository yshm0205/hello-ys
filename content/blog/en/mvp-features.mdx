# 5 Must-Have Features for Your SaaS MVP

Building an MVP? Here are the features you absolutely need.

## 1. Authentication

Revenue from day one matters. Stripe provides:

Your landing page should answer:

- What problem do you solve?
- How do you solve it?
- What does it cost?

## 4. Dashboard

Users need a place to manage their account:

- Profile settings
- Subscription status
- Core features

## 5. Email Notifications

Keep users engaged:

- Welcome email
- Payment receipts
- Important updates

## Launch Fast

Don't over-engineer. These 5 features are enough to validate your idea. Ship it!
